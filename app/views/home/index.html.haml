      I first met Jerel when I came home to my apartment one night. My roommate was dating his friend, and they were all hanging out.
      I instantly felt connected to him; he had the ability to make me laugh at anything. I knew from the moment I met him that I wanted to get to know him better.
      It took an agonizingly long month for him to realize that he wanted the same thing.

    %p
      Ever since then, he has been one of my closest friends, and I really can’t imagine the last few years of college without him.
      The seventy-mile distance made it difficult to see each other, but we managed to get together a few times a month.
      We have shared a lot of joy over the years and I am so excited to be getting married to Jerel.
      I can’t wait to see where life takes us!

      I still remember the moment before I met Liz. I was in her apartment hanging out with one of my friends and his girlfriend. I remember looking
      at their whiteboard hung on the wall with the name "Liz" written on it and wondering who she was and if I would be interested
      in getting to know her more. Little did I know that I would be standing here today preparing to marry her.

    %p
      Liz is the definition of radiance and brilliance. Her smile has the ability to turn a cloudy day into a beautiful display of amazing. Much like
      her smile, she has been such a radiance and brilliance in my life. Her love for God and glowing personality continues to amaze me. I have
      been blessed to the fullest and I cannot wait to share my life with her.
